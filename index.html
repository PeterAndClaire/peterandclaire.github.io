<h3 id="welcome">Welcome to our wedding website.</h3>

<p>Below you will find details about our wedding.
This website will continue to be updated in the coming months.</p>
<p>-Peter &amp; Claire</p>

<h3 id="ceremony">Ceremony</h3>
<p>The ceremony will begin at 5:30 PM in Gas Works Park.
The street address is <b>2101 N Northlake Way, Seattle, WA 98103</b>.
We will be on the east side of the park.
There is a parking lot at Gas Works, but we recommend taking a taxi, Uber, Lyft, carpool, bicycle, or bus!
The reception location is an easy 15 minute walk from the ceremony location along the waterfront of Lake Union.

<h3 id="lodging">Lodging</h3>
<p>There are many hotels in downtown Seattle, which is less than 15 minutes away from the ceremony and reception locations by car. In addition, for a more affordable (and social!) option, there is a <a href="http://www.hotelhotel.co/">hostel</a> a very short walk from the wedding locations. We hope many of you will stay there!</p>
<p>The Watertown Hotel is reasonably close to the wedding location, and you can use the offer code "WED" when you book through their <a href="http://www.staypineapple.com">website</a> to save 15%.</p>

<h3 id="registry">Registry</h3>
<p>Your presence at the wedding is more valuable to us than presents!
However, if you would like to buy a gift we will register at several locations, and list them here soon.</p>
